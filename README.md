  <h2 align="center">Calc (slang for calculator)</h2>

This is my first project.
I have tried to make the calculator look neat and colourful to make it stand out.
It performs the four basic operations.
It is made on C#

#UPDATE

Added Two new functions.
SQUARE ROOT AND PERCENT.

Changed the Colours and theme to make it more appealing.
Rearranged and resized the buttons.

Corrected the alignment of the buttons which were misaligned.
